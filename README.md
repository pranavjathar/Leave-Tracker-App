Welcome to the Mini Leave Tracker App, a learning project built on Salesforce using Lightning Web Components (LWC). This application offers real-time updates with auto-refresh functionality, ensuring a seamless user experience. Date validation prevents selecting past dates for leave applications, while toast messages provide clear feedback. Leave statuses are managed dynamically, allowing editing of pending leaves and restricting changes once approved or rejected. Additionally, users can add comments during the approval or rejection process for better communication. Visual cues, such as dynamic color changes, enhance the understanding of leave request statuses. Start tracking your leaves efficiently with our intuitive and feature-rich Mini Leave Tracker App!
